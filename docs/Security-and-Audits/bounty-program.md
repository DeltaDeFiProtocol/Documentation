# Bounty program

The DeltaDeFi bug bounty program supports a community-led effort to improve the on-chain security of the DeltaDeFi Protocol. Contributors who make a valuable security discoveries - such as detecting a previously unknown smart contract bug - will be rewarded a bounty according to the rules outlined below.

## Rules

The are rules adopted from Cardano Foundation & hackone bug bounty program rules and applicable for the DeltaDeFi protocol bug bounty program:

* Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
* Submit one vulnerability per-report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
* When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
* Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
* Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with the explicit permission of the account holder.
* All software within the scope of this programme must be run in testnet mode.
* Any type of connection to nodes other than the one run by the Hacker is prohibited.
* Testnet funds can be retrieved from the faucet and should be used sparingly.

## Scope

Attack vectors that affect the off-chain components of an architecture are outside of the scope of the bounty programme but their submission is still welcome. Examples of such threats are:

* Vulnerabilities in the supported 3rd party wallets
* XSS attacks
* DDoS

Smart contract bugs that do not lead to a loss of funds might be classified as not bearing any threats and thus not eligible for the bounty.

The scope of the present bounty is focused solely on smart contracts developed by the DeltaDeFi core contributors for the DeltaDeFi protocol. The list of codebases eligible for the bounty program includes:

* github repo 1
* github repo 2

If a vulnerability satifies the previously highlighted criteria but is not included in the list of repositories above, its eligibility will be at the discretion of the DeltaDeFi DAO.

## Compensation

* High threat - up to 100,000 iUSD
* Medium threat - up to 20,000 iUSD
* Low threat - up to 2,000 iUSD

The reward will be delivered only after ascertaining the severity of the reported issue and the successful implementation of a patch to the reported exploit.

## Submission process

Send your bug findings to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/3CQrcHc5) via direct message.

The vulnerability must not be disclosed publicly or to any other person, entity or email address before DeltaDeFi Team has been notified, has fixed the issue, and has granted permission for public disclosure. In addition, disclosure must be made within 24 hours following discovery of the vulnerability.

A detailed report of a vulnerability increases the likelihood of a reward and may increase the reward amount. Please provide as much information about the vulnerability as possible, including:

* The conditions on which reproducing the bug is contingent
* The steps needed to reproduce the bug or, preferably, a proof of concept
* The potential implications of the vulnerability being abused

Anyone who reports a unique, previously-unreported vulnerability that results in a change to the code or a configuration change and who keeps such vulnerability confidential until it has been resolved by our engineers will be recognized publicly for their contribution if they choose so.
