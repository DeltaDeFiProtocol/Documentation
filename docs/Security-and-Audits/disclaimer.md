# Disclaimer

The DeltaDeFi protocol is a smart contract or a set of smart contracts available on demand as software to facilitate trustless contracts. It doesn't offer a service or advice of any kind, neither can it be considered a finished product. The protocol as a whole is currently under active development. It will be tested by the community and within the scope of the bug bounty program. The code will be open-source and available on GitHub; contributions are accepted as a part of governance mining. 

There are several inherent risks associated with the protocol, the most typical being:

* Delays in or complete failure of transactions being confirmed
* Faults, defeats, hacks, exploits, errors, or unforeseen circumstances occurring in respect of the platform or the technologies that the platform depends on
* Loss of private keys
* Attacks on the platform or the technologies that the platform depends on such as distributed denial of service, phishing, social engineering, hacking, smurfing, malware, double spending, majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks, misinformation campaigns, forks, and spoofing

The first version of the protocol will live on Cardano mainnet and will be audited by independent 3rd parties. However, the future audits will not give any warranties on the security of the code, utility of the code, sustainability of the business model, regulatory regime for the business model, or any other statement about fitness of the contracts to purpose, or their bug free status. The audit findings will be for discussion and educational purposes only. You should always conduct your own research and risk analysis.
