# Governance Flow

## Proposal Discussion

Governance token holders could create a discussion on the DeltaDeFi forum. Governance token holders should stay objective and list all pros and cons of your proposal, so every community member can make up their mind about the initiative. However, the token holders could explain and advocate for their point of view freely in the comments.

## Proposal Submission

Making the proposal is the final step before actual voting. The proposal with the clear points that can be voted on with a Yes (Agree) or No (Disagree). If the proposal implies some actions add a batch of transactions while creating a voting proposal.

## Voting

The voting period must be over certain time period so that community members will have the opportunity  to evaluate the initiative make up their minds and vote on it. However, for urgent matters this requirement can be dropped.

## Execution
