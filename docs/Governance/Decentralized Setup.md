# Decentralized Setup

The goal of the DeltaDeFi is to achieve full decentralization through the appropriate ecosystem. The framework was designed which combines financial incentives with decentralized governance mechanisms to achieve transparency, security, and sustainability of protocol's growth and development over time.

In the future, we would consider issuing governance tokens. The governance token holders would have the power to propose actions, vote on them, and allocate funds to support selected initiatives.
