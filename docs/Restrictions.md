# Restrictions

1. The DeltaDeFi protocol is for sophisticated users only. It should be clear that despite the underlying technology of the DeltaDeFi protocol being simple to use, the creation of financial contracts requires knowledge and experience. Thus, DeltaDeFi is not meant to be broadly adopted by end-users; it serves primarily the community of developers and DeFi professionals, who are able to evaluate associated risks, including, but not limited to, the technical failure and permanent capital loss. 

2. To be compliant with the local regulations, the DeltaDeFi protocol can’t be accessed by citizens and residents of some jurisdictions. Although it is impossible to prevent users from the restricted territories from accessing blockchain and development modules, the website and other parts of the DeltaDeFi ecosystem will be blocked for certain geographies. Please note that by trying to access DeltaDeFi via VPN or lying about your citizenship you are breaking the law. It’s essential to understand that the parallel with traditional financial tools such as derivatives is drawn solely for a simplified explanation of DeltaDeFi’s possibilities. Despite seeming similarity, DeFi tools are quite different, with their unique costs and benefits, risks and protection mechanisms. For example “call option” on a decentralized protocol may describe a financial primitive that behaves like a “call option spread” most of the time, but has some crucial differences in terms of counterparty risk (managed by blockchain), settlement asset, technological risks and underlying asset.

3. The DeltaDeFi protocol provides software that enables and enforces transactions between two or more parties without a traditional centralized intermediary but via a smart contract. If the software fails to execute an operation due to malfunction, exploit or underperformance, parties may lose their funds without the ability to bring the case to the court of law for arbitration. A smart contract isn’t a person, neither it is controlled by any person or persons and thus it cannot be forced in court or otherwise to pause, reverse or change a transaction. There is no legal enforcement associated with the contract. Please make sure you fully understand how this software operates, the incentive mechanism that it employs, implications of technical failure and other protocol-specific risks before using any of the DeltaDeFi products. 

4. When in doubt, please refer to the Terms and Conditions that can be found at The DeltaDeFi website and other parts of the DeltaDeFi ecosystem. To learn more about the software, please review the technical documentation and code. 

5. Never transact with funds you can't affort to lose.
